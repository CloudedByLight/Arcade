# Arcade
A project web application designed for PC devices, containing classic games like Snake, TicTacToe & Pong.

Hosted on: https://ralph-arcade.netlify.app/

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS

# Controls

- Pong: Mouse move. Simply hover the mouse up and down on the game container to control the paddle.
- TicTacToe: Click. Press on the tile you'd like to place a mark on.
- Snake: Arrow Keys. From your keyboard, use arrow keys to control the snake's direction.

# Quirks

The application is contained within a single html file, which dynamically rearranges itself using JS scripts 
to generate game UIs and functionality. This is meant to illustrate DOM understanding and demonstrate Advanced
JS use in the form of ES6 classes.
